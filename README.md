## Design 

### Imagery 
The use of imagery on the simplify website is very minimal and used only to give the sense of calm as the user begins to organize their tasks.

### Colors
The colors used in this website were selected based on the hero image and the colors therein. A sixties/seventies movie credits style was captured on the hero image and was implemented through out the Kanban boards appropriately. 

### Fonts 
'Play' was used for the logo and text througout the website due to its formal but yet relaxed appearance.
